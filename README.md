# tex-tutorial-23
Repository to the TeX/python crash course for 2nd year physics students at University of Stuttgart in the Winter Term 23/24

## Preliminaries
While some students have undoubtedly heard of TeX due to them taking the _Wahlbereich Mathematik Alternative 1_, containing the _Computergrundlagen_ lecture,
the students of the second alternative have not encountered TeX or python during their studies. 
As it is best practice to use TeX to produce reports of scientific nature, and python being one of the most powerful programming languages for physicists,
this course aims to equalize the knowledge of the typesetting language TeX and the python programming language between physics students.
